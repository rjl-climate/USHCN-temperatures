# Notes

1. Monthly data station IDs don't having matching IDS in the station inventory file

## Research Questions:

1. Are maximum temperatures rising or falling?

    - get the stations with the longest data
    - compute the trend of maximum temperatures (maximum and average)
    - explore sensitivity to the duration of records

2. Are the number of very hot days increasing?

    - get the stations with the longest data
    - compute the trend of the annual number of days that temperatures exceed a threshold

3. If 1 or 2 appears true, is there a correlation with urban areas?

    - spatial plot of station disappearance over time
    - investigate the relationship between station disappearance and urbanization
    - investigate the relationship between station location (rural/urban) and temperature trends
