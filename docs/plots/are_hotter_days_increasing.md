# Are hotter days increasing ?

**Hotter days are not increasing.**

The climate catastrophe hypothesis predicts that the number of hotter days should increase over time.
They don't.

In this graph, we plot the number of days that measurements exceed a measure of "very hot" as a percentage
of all the measurements in that year. We've removed all of the stations that have less than 100 years of data
to ensure that we remove that as a confounding factor.
