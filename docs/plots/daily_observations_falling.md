# Are daily observations falling?

**Daily observations are falling.**

Data from the US Historical Climatology Network is used to support the claim that
the weather is changing for the worse. Given the implications of the claim, it's
reasonable to assess the quality of the network.

One way to do this is to look at the number of observations that are made each day.
